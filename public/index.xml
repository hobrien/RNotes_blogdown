      <description>I had the pleasure of attending Alison Hill‚Äôs RMarkdown workshop in Canberra on Monday and I came away with so many tips and tricks! It was brillant.
Alison covered A LOT over the course of the day. I learned lots of the power of yaml, how to create parameterised reports, and how to make a package that contains customised .Rmd templates. Each of those topics are blogposts for another day, but my favourite bit was making a beautiful Academic theme blogdown site.</description>

      <description>Cute #rstats monster art by the amazing Allison Horst.
I have been using gather() and spread() a lot lately. I‚Äôm on the tidy data train; long data is essential for ggplot etc, but sometimes you want to do calculations row wise, which is kinda complicated.
For example, this week Matilda and I were working with her language/locomotion data and we were looking at the number of action-directed, affirmative, and descriptive responses that parents make to their infants.</description>

      <description>There has been lots of talk about blogdown on #rstats Twitter recently and people have been talking up the Hugo ‚ÄúAcademic theme‚Äù.
I want to give it a go to update my lab website, so thought it might be a good idea to pull together all the useful links I‚Äôve seen recently into one place.
Alison Hill I used Alison‚Äôs blog post when I first set up this blog. It looks like she has updated the post recently, so it is probably still a good place to start.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been analysing some future thinking data and playing around with packages that can do repeated ANOVA (I know, I should do LMM). There is more than one way to skin a cat and the differences come down to two things.
the intuitiveness of the function arguments the readibility of the output  Some checks to do before you start - all of these packages assume that you within and between subjects variables are factors, but also that your participant id is a factor</description>

      <description>How would we learn R if not for google? Here are some things I googled this week (and mostly not for the first time).
1. how to install a package from github. 95% of the time, packages I want are on CRAN and I can just use the install.packages function to install them.
install.packages(&amp;quot;nameofthepackage&amp;quot;)  Occasionally though, I see something cool and new on Twitter and need to install from github.</description>

      <description>Learning new things is HARD. Stats methods are particularly hard because it not just about running the test. You have to‚Ä¶
 learn when to run the test learn how to run the test learn how to interpret the test AND learn how to write about the results of the test  Part of what makes this learning hard is that our research methods training has drummed into us that there is a RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.</description>

      <description>This content has appeared before in a dirty data post, but I still find myself googling these functions. So they deserve a post of their own. The tidyr package has several functions that allow you to reshape your data. They are surprisely useful; I have found myself gathering a lot, mostly to get data from &amp;ldquo;SPSS format&amp;rdquo; into something that ggplot will handle. I have also discovered the flexibility with which you can spread the data on a particular variable, do a set of computations, and then gather it back for plotting&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>In the kind of research that we do, t-tests can only take you so far. Most often we design factorial experiments where we are interested in both main effects and interactions. Because we work with infants and young children, who are both expensive to recruit/test and notoriously variable in their behaviour, we try to design experiments that use within-subjects designs; each child gives us more than one data point and we need to use repeated-measures analyses.</description>

      <description>It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing).
Did you know up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data? - cf. Wickham, 2014 and Dasu and Johnson, 2003

      <description>I am a developmental psychologist in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. My research investigates age-related changes in learning, memory, and emotion understanding in infants and preschoolers. Babies and kids tend not to tell you what they remember or understand, so we use method like eyetracking and psychophysiology to record subtle changes in their behaviour. These methods produce a LOT of data.

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t love cats. I am not a member of @RCatLadies. So the fact that Tidyverse packages for dealing with factors and functional programming have cat-related names (forcats and purrr) does not endear them to me.
I knew there was a time when I would encounter an R problem that needed the power of for loops, so when I asked the Twittersphere whether there was an alternative (hopefully a tidyverse one) that would allow me to avoid loops a little longer, I was a bit disappointed to hear that it is the purrr package.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day&amp;hellip; another data set. This time I am trying to get EMG data from LabChart into R. LabChart is the software we use to record EMG data and do the first steps of data cleaning/processing. At the moment a good chunk of the cleaning process involves Excel macros, so my goal is to replicate what we have traditionally done in Excel in R, so that it is more automated and more reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been playing with a new (not actually new, but new to R) dataset this week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been travelling for the last few weeks, first to a teaching conference at Duke called PsychOne, and then to the International Congress on Infant Studies (ICIS) in Philadelphia. There was a surprising amount of #rstats at ICIS which was awesome. Everyone is talking about reproducible science and preregistration and best practices that will improve our field. There is definitely another blog post needed to consolidate my notes from ICIS, but for now, I want to write about #useR2018 (a conference I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What a treat it was to finally meet &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cantabile&#34;&gt;Charles Gray&lt;/a&gt; when she was in Sydney last week. She ran her R-Curious workshop for us and I picked up so many useful markdown tips.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is such a great R learning resource.
The people who follow the #rstats hashtag are so generous with their time. You can post a question/problem with the hashtag and someone will reply and try and help you within about 20 min. It is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cantabile&#34;&gt;Charles Gray&lt;/a&gt; was extraordinarily generous with her time tonight trying to help be troubleshoot deploying this site (love R-ladies). I learned a lot about git.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
