      <description>In the kind of research that we do, t-tests can only take you so far. Most often we design factorial experiments where we are interested in both main effects and interactions. Because we work with infants and young children, who are both expensive to recruit/test and notoriously variable in their behaviour, we try to design experiments that use within-subjects designs; each child gives us more than one data point and we need to use repeated-measures analyses.</description>

      <description>It is definitely true that it takes much longer to get your data ready for analysis than it does to actually analyse it. Apparently up to 80% of the data analysis time is spent wrangling data (and cursing and swearing).
Did you know up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data? - cf. Wickham, 2014 and Dasu and Johnson, 2003
So here is an excellent approach to data wrangling in #rstats https://t.</description>

      <description>This is me
 I am a developmental psychologist in the School of Psychology at UNSW Sydney. My research investigates age-related changes in learning, memory, and emotion understanding in infants and preschoolers. Babies and kids tend not to tell you what they remember or understand, so we use method like eyetracking and psychophysiology to record subtle changes in their behaviour. These methods produce a LOT of data.
This blog is a record of my R learning journey as I venture into new data wrangling and analysis approaches.</description>

      <description>I was trying to work out how to do t-tests using my own data and the lsr package but ended up working with Dani’s AFL data from her book while trying to work out why R insisted that my outcome variable wasn’t numeric (it definitely was). Turns out that the lsr package doesn’t deal well with tibbles (which are created by default when you use read_csv to get your data) but if you use read.</description>

      <description>I am feeling more confident about my resolution to get rid of Excel and only use R for data wrangling and visualisation. Next steps&amp;hellip; analysis.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting simple (I presume) with t-tests. Mostly commonly I want to determine whether there is a difference in the performance of independent groups of kids, or a difference between kids&amp;rsquo; performance on two different conditions, or whether kids are just guessing (i.e. whether their performance differs significantly chance).</description>

      <description>The frequency with which my data is missing important information when it gets to R is a bit embarrassing. I&amp;rsquo;m sure as I learn what kind of information R needs I&amp;rsquo;ll get better at this but for the moment using functions like rep() to create variables like trial number or block has been super useful.
Alison Smith has a great blog called Very Statisticious and her post about simulating data is super helpful.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t love cats. I am not a member of @RCatLadies. So the fact that Tidyverse packages for dealing with factors and functional programming have cat-related names (forcats and purrr) does not endear them to me.
I knew there was a time when I would encounter an R problem that needed the power of for loops, so when I asked the Twittersphere whether there was an alternative (hopefully a tidyverse one) that would allow me to avoid loops a little longer, I was a bit disappointed to hear that it is the purrr package.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been doing lots of data wrangling recently and decided a needed a quick rundown of data cleaning in R. Turns out www.DataCamp.com has a course called exactly that. Here are notes on useful things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day&amp;hellip; another data set. This time I am trying to get EMG data from LabChart into R. LabChart is the software we use to record EMG data and do the first steps of data cleaning/processing. At the moment a good chunk of the cleaning process involves Excel macros, so my goal is to replicate what we have traditionally done in Excel in R, so that it is more automated and more reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been travelling for the last few weeks, first to a teaching conference at Duke called PsychOne, and then to the International Congress on Infant Studies (ICIS) in Philadelphia. There was a surprising amount of #rstats at ICIS which was awesome. Everyone is talking about reproducible science and preregistration and best practices that will improve our field. There is definitely another blog post needed to consolidate my notes from ICIS, but for now, I want to write about #useR2018 (a conference I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go to).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>What a treat it was to finally meet Charles Gray when she was in Sydney last week. She ran her R-Curious workshop for us and I picked up so many useful markdown tips.
 We worked from an Rmarkdown document in the workshop so we could edit the code and add our own notes but we could also how Charles had used specific markdown formatting to produce the document.
Because it was a “lets start at the very beginning” workshop, made me realise that when you teach yourself how to code, there are basic (but quite useful) that you don’t end up learning via osmosis.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter is such a great R learning resource.
The people who follow the #rstats hashtag are so generous with their time. You can post a question/problem with the hashtag and someone will reply and try and help you within about 20 min. It is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
