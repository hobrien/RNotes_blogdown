      <description>Twitter is such a great R learning resource.
The people who follow the #rstats hashtag are so generous with their time. You can post a qusetion/problem with the hashtag and someone will reply and try and help you within about 20 min. It is awesome.
Other initiatives like #TidyTuesday provide datawrangling fodder for learners and then a forum to share success (and challenges). Every tuesday @thomas_mock posts a dataset to github, people download it, wrangle it, play with it, plot it and then post their results to twitter with the hashtag #tidytuesday.</description>
