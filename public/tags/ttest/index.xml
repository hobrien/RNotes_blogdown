      <description>TAKE HOME MESSAGE Here is what I learned about t-tests from doing the analysis below.
From the lsr package I like that the lsr has separate functions for each kind of t-test. I can see how that will make it easier for students to think about the differences between each test, and the arguments that each one requires. The output from the lsr is also REALLY nice. It includes useful things like Cohens D by default.</description>

      <description>I am feeling more confident about my resolution to get rid of Excel and only use R for data wrangling and visualisation. Next steps&amp;hellip; analysis.
I&amp;rsquo;m starting simple (I presume) with t-tests. Mostly commonly I want to determine whether there is a difference in the performance of independent groups of kids, or a difference between kids&amp;rsquo; performance on two different conditions, or whether kids are just guessing (i.e. whether their performance differs significantly chance).</description>
