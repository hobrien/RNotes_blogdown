There are some commands that as I get more and more familiar with RStudio that I find myself typing again and again. 

Here is a list of helpful keyboard shortcuts (disclaimer: these mac versions).

1. Alt/Option + Command i will open a new Rmarkdown code chunk. 

2. Alt/Option - is a handy way of typing assignment (<-)

3. Shift + Command + M is a fast way of adding a pipe (%>%)

Any others I should know about?
