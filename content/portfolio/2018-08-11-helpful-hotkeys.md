There are some commands that as I get more and more familiar with Rstudio I find myself typing again and again. 

Keyboard shortcuts are helpful (disclaimer: these mac versions).

1. Option-Command-i will open a new Rmarkdown code chunk. 

2. Option - is a handy way of typing assignment (<-)

3. Shift-Command-M is a fast way of adding a pipe (%>%)

Any others I should know about?
