I am feeling more confident about my resolution to get rid of Excel and only use R for data wrangling and visualisation. Next steps... analysis. 

I'm starting simple (I presume) with t-tests. Mostly commonly I want to determine whether there is a difference in the performance of independent groups of kids, or a difference between kids' performance on two different conditions, or whether kids are just guessing (i.e. whether their performance differs significantly chance). 

So I need to learn how to do:
- independent samples t-tests
- paired samples t-tests
- one-sample t-tests

Lets see what the AMAZING [Dani Navarro](@djnavarro) says about t-tests in her free online stats resources [found here](https://compcogscisydney.org/psyr/)
