The amazing Charles Gray was extraordinarily generous with her time tonight trying to help be troubleshoot deploying this site (love R-ladies). I learned a lot about git. 

To push to git you need to use the terminal from WITHIN R-Studio (who knew there was such a thing, shortcut = alt-shift-t). You need to type these commands in sequence. 

1. git add .

2. git commit -m "something that makes sense"

3. git push

We typed those three things SO MANY TIMES that I actually learned them- woot!

Now I also know how to check whether things worked, just type

git status
